* Purpose
»Scrabble for one computer«. Generate and print a crossword-like matrix of horizontally and vertically overlapping words from a set using a heuristic algorithm. Not all words are guaranteed to be placed, and the solution is not always the  best possible one.

Performance is fast up to matrices of 50x50 and somewhere around 500 words.

* Usage
Invoke =main.py= without arguments, or see =--help=!

Samples:
- =./main.py --size 40 bork pork fish steak=
- =./main.py --file ebook.txt=
* Prerequisites
- Uses [[https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Nosetest]] for testing.
- Python 2.7 (might work under 3 with minimal tweaking)
* Testing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
easy_install nose # or pip install nose
osetests
#+END_SRC

For continuous testing on file changes, run =watch_files.sh= (requires inotifywait from inotify-tools).

You can enable debugging output (printing of end-of-word markers and empty cell markers) in the top of lettermatrix.py.
* Known issues
1. The algorithm is very slow when the word list is significantly larger than what would fit in the matrix, a very common case for a word list with many words of similar size. If you find that the algorithm is performing very slowly, try increasing the matrix size using the =--size= argument.

2. Due to how words and letters are rated, the algoritm can be tricked to place a bad starting word if it has sufficiently many uncommon characters compared to other words in the list. For such an example, see e.g. =./main.py zzzzzz bye=.

3. /All/ non-ASCII characters are filtered.

4. Unicode might not work (besides all Unicode characters being filtered)
