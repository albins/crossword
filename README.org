* Purpose
»Scrabble for one computer«. Generate and print a crossword-like matrix of horizontally and vertically overlapping words from a set using an approximative algorithm.

* Usage
Invoke =main.py= without arguments, or see =--help=!

Samples:
- =./main.py --size 40 bork pork fish steak=
- =./main.py --file ebook.txt=
* Prerequisites
- Uses [[https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Nosetest]] for testing.
- Python 2.7 (might work under 3 with minimal tweaking)
* Testing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
easy_install nose # or pip install nose
osetests
#+END_SRC

For continuous testing on file changes, run =watch_files.sh= (requires inotifywait from inotify-tools).

You can enable debugging output (printing of end-of-word markers and empty cell markers) in the top of lettermatrix.py.
